            <h4>HI!</h4>
            <p>I'm Roger van Hout. Originally a conceptual artist, 
                with an emphasis on new media. From the beginning of times, 
                I'm messing around with computers. At first, the

                , later the A1200 and eventually Intels and Macs. Making music (yes, you can find me on the

                and messing around with the video capabilities of the A1200, making games and animations using animated 
                gifs, html flash and now, javascript.

            <p>
                I live in a small village near Groningen with my wife Ruth, 
                dog Oki, cats Yolo and Arafat and bunnies Lily and Severus.
                I'm a highly creative, apparently gifted introvert who likes to
                learn, play and discover new things. My short term goal is to become 
                able in php and angular.
